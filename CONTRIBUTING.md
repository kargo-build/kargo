# Contributing to Kargo

Contributions are welcome.

If you plan to submit significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposal.

## Development Philosophy

Kargo evolves independently from Amper and follows its own design principles:

- Explicit over implicit behavior
- Deterministic builds
- Native-first workflows
- Long-term architectural clarity

Not all changes from upstream are adopted, and not all design decisions aim for compatibility with Amper.

## Code Contributions

- Keep changes focused and well-explained.
- Include tests when applicable.
- Avoid unrelated refactoring in the same PR.

## Questions

Open a GitHub issue for discussions and proposals.
