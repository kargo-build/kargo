## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by opening a private issue addressed to the maintainers.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated fairly and in good faith.

Project maintainers reserve the right to take appropriate action,
including warning or removal from the project.
